# 🎯 Face Detection with Custom Confidence-Weighted IoU Loss

This project demonstrates how to create and test a **custom loss function** in PyTorch designed to improve bounding box accuracy in face detection systems. It introduces a **Confidence-Weighted IoU (CwIoU) Loss** that penalizes confident but inaccurate predictions more heavily — useful in models like YOLOv5.

- PyTorch 1.8+
- (Optional) Virtual environment

### 📦 Install dependencies

pip install torch
▶️ Run the sample

python train_sample.py
📸 Sample Output

Confidence-Weighted IoU Loss: 0.1053
Replace dummy data in train_sample.py with real detection outputs to test in your actual model pipeline.

🧪 How It Works
The custom loss function is defined as:

𝑚
𝑎
𝑡
ℎ
𝑐

𝑙

𝐶

​
 =
sum 
i=1
N
​
 c

​
 
cdot(1−IoU

Where:

𝑐

  = confidence of the predicted bounding box

𝐼

𝑁
N = total number of predictions in the batch
